Here I present some of the basic scripts in simulating complex systems using various algoritmhs from scipy library.
- birdsinflock - simulate the behaviour of birds in flock under some simple assumptions
- diffusionmodelongrpah - introduction to graphs manipulation and diffusion modelling
- Simulation ALD - modelling ALD process in a box-limited reactor with adjustable surface and trenches.
  The dynamics of the precursors are to be expanded. Currently the particles behaves like gas with L-J potential. New methods are about to be developed.
